<p>Placing ads on the State Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange of Turkmenistan website is a paid service. The cost of one publication is 100 manats.</p>

<p>To place an ad to the site:</p>

<p><em>2. Next, fill in all the required fields marked with a red asterisk. Then press the "STEP 2" button.</em></p>

<p>Note! The name of the product must be written in three languages so that they are displayed on the site with different language settings. If you do not have the opportunity to translate the text, insert into all the fields the one in which you wrote the original. It is important to understand that the buyer who does not speak your language, will not be able to respond to the offer.</p>

<p>Be sure to check the correctness of filling in the section and the type of market.</p>

<p><em>3. On the new page, fill in all the fields, write a description and upload high quality product images. Go to the next step.</em></p>

<p><em>4. Next, you need to check the correctness of all the data and click "Pay" on the right side of the page. The cost for the publication will be indicated above the button.</em></p>

<p>All created announcements can be found in the section "My announcements". If there are not enough funds in the account to publish, the ad will be marked "Draft". After replenishment of the balance, you can publish it by clicking the "Finish" button.</p>

<p>Note! The ad publication period is 30 days. After that, it can be deleted (if the seller has changed his mind or the product has already been bought) or published again.</p>

<p>Before publication, each ad is sent for moderation, and becomes available in the list only after its successful completion. The moderator has the right to edit any ad.</p>
